## Just a word

This is a very simple web page that fills the browser window with some specified text.

Maybe it's useful for testing something?  Or maybe sometimes you just want to put a word on your screen.

## Usage

Go to [https://sbj42.github.io/just-a-word](https://sbj42.github.io/just-a-word) to try it out.  Just add '#' and a word to the end of the URL.

Examples:
* [YES](https://sbj42.github.io/just-a-word#YES)
* [ðŸ¤”](https://sbj42.github.io/just-a-word#ðŸ¤”)
* [Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya](https://sbj42.github.io/just-a-word#Hello,%20my%20name%20is%20Inigo%20Montoya)

## Other options

The default is black-on-white.  You can invert the colors by adding `invert|` to the beginning.  For instance:

* [Darkness](https://sbj42.github.io/just-a-word#invert|Darkness) (inverted)
